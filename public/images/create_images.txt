To complete the background visuals, you'll need two images:

1. visceral_map.png - A semi-transparent map of the constellation that gradually appears
   as you complete more of the scanning. This should be a drawn/stylized representation 
   of the star systems with connecting lines, possibly with runes or ancient markings.

2. Optional: You can also create a more detailed starfield_bg.png to replace the 
   gradient background if desired.

These images should be placed in this public/images/ directory.
